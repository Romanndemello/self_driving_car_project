*SELF DRIVING CAR*

This project demonstrates a self-driving car simulation using pure JavaScript, 
where a car learns to navigate a track without colliding with obstacles. 
By implementing neural networks and machine learning concepts, 
the car improves its decision-making over time, finding the optimal path through trial and error. 
This simulation highlights the power of AI in autonomous systems and serves as a practical example of neural networks in action.
